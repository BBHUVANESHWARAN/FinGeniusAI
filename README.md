# FinGeniusAI

🧠 1. Objective

The goal of FinGenius AI is to help users manage, automate, and improve their financial life using Agentic AI — a system where multiple AI agents collaborate intelligently to:

Track expenses

Reduce debt

File taxes

Plan investments

Visualize financial journeys

Offer personalized, human-like financial advice

It acts like a personal financial team, available 24×7 — analyzing, planning, and advising based on your goals.

🎯 2. Purpose

Modern people use 4–5 different apps for money tracking, bills, taxes, and investments — all disconnected.
FinGenius AI solves this by combining everything in one unified AI-driven platform, where each financial task is handled by an autonomous AI agent that communicates with others.

In short: Your money manager + coach + advisor + storyteller = FinGenius AI.

💡 3. Core Idea

FinGenius AI uses Agentic AI — a system where AI agents:

Understand your goals and data

Communicate with each other (via LangGraph / CrewAI)

Take actions (like reminders, analysis, generating plans)

The app is bilingual (Tamil + English), free to use (Gemini API + open-source tools), and built for individuals, families, and small businesses.

⚙️ 5. How It Works (Flow)
User Flow:
